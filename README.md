# üî• A Seamless Installer for Flameshot on Ubuntu 24.04 Gnome Wayland


This script installs [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org) and sets a custom GNOME keyboard shortcut to launch it with the `Print` key ‚Äî properly configured to work under **Wayland**, the default session in Ubuntu 24.04+.

---

## ‚ùì Why this repo?

Ubuntu 24.04 uses **Wayland** instead of X11.  
As a result, many users encounter **‚ÄúUnable to capture screen‚Äù** errors when using Flameshot with default GNOME shortcuts.

This script solves the issue by:
- Setting `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland`
- Automating GNOME shortcut creation for the Print key
